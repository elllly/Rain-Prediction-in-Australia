# Rain Prediction in Australia

Overview:
---------
This repository contains the code and documentation for my Rain Prediction project, which focuses on predicting rainfall in Australia. The project involves applying various machine learning algorithms and evaluating their performance using a range of metrics.

Key Features:
--------------
- Diverse ML Approaches: Applied multiple machine learning algorithms, including Linear Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines (SVM), to predict rainfall in Australia. Utilized the strengths of each algorithm to enhance prediction accuracy.

- Model Evaluation Metrics: Evaluated the performance of the models using a comprehensive set of metrics, including Accuracy, Jaccard Index, F1-Score, LogLoss, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R2-Score. This comprehensive assessment provides a holistic view of the model's effectiveness.

Dependencies:
--------------
- Python 3.x
- Scikit-learn
